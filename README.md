# PavementUtilizationStudy
An in depth study of how autonomous vehicles might change utilization of pavement in both Urban/Rural areas.
Reusing code from https://github.com/CosmiQ/basiss all credits to owner for creation of model pipeline.

By using resources available online and reusing the bassiss pipeline we are able to answer questions about current pavement utilization of american cities and potentially other parts of the world as well as speculate what advantages might be brought by autonomous vehicles per pavement utilization.
